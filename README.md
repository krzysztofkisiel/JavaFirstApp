# JavaFirstApp
I've created a 'Car Rental' application, that allows You to:
- add accounts (clients)
- add cars
- add loans
- show accounts
- show cars
- show and manage loans
There is weak validation on data fields (there is validation, but it's simple).
I'm using mySql database with jdbc driver, and JUnit ver. 3.8.1
Patterns used: decorator, dao and template method. 
Multi-layer app, using interfaces and abstraction. 
Built with maven, with included 5 unit tests (passed).
Pushed into git repository.
